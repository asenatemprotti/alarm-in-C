## Alarm in c

This project whas my homework. It's basicly a alarm clock that the user needs to put whats the time now and whats the time you want it to go off, after it the program will run a digital clock' and when it's the time you want to go off it will bip. 
 
  There is `2 versions` of them, one i made for fun with conio and bip's until you press 0 and the other bip's only one time and if you want to you can end the program pressing 0.
